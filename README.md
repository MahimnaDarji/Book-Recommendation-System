# Book Recommendation System
This project is a full-stack book recommendation system made to give readers personalized book suggestions using content-based filtering. Along with accurate recommendations, it also has a clean and easy-to-use website that makes the overall experience more enjoyable for users.

## Key Features:

### User Authentication:
We created a secure system where users can register, log in, and manage their accounts without any hassle. The login and signup pages are designed to be simple and smooth so users can easily access features made just for them.

### Home Page:
The home page is the main place where users land. It’s built to be neat and easy to navigate, helping users quickly go to different sections like exploring genres or checking personalized recommendations. It also explains what the platform does and why it's useful.

### Genre Categorization:
All books are properly grouped by their genres to make browsing easy. A special genre page helps users explore different types of books like fiction, history, romance, and more. This makes it easier for people to find books they actually enjoy reading.

### Content-Based Filtering Recommendation Engine:
At the heart of the system is a smart recommendation engine. It checks each book’s genre, author, and description to suggest similar books to the user. It also looks at what kind of books or genres the user has seen before to make better and more relevant suggestions.

### Genre Page:
This page shows a variety of books across many genres. Users can simply pick the genres they like, and the system will show them books related to that. It’s a fun way for users to explore and find new books they might not have come across otherwise.

### Recommendation Page:
This page gives suggestions that are specially made for each user. It gets updated based on the genres and books they clicked on earlier. This makes the recommendations more meaningful and helps users discover books that match their taste and reading style.
